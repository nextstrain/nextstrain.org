Scope: https://nextstrain.org and https://auspice.us, any other custom Auspice server

[January 22, 2025] We have applied [a
workaround](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/pull/1932) for the 1Password
extension issue in Auspice version 2.62.0.
[nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org) and [auspice.us](https://auspice.us)
have been updated with this new version.

We recently became aware that recent versions of the [1Password browser
extension](https://1password.com/downloads/browser-extension) are interfering
with Auspice visualizations, leading to slowness and in some cases
unresponsiveness. We are actively working with the 1Password support team to
resolve the problem.

In the meantime, consider disabling the extension in your browser's settings if
you are experiencing difficulty viewing datasets. More information, workarounds,
and updates can be found in a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/issues/1919).
