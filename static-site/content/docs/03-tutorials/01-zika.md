title: "Zika Tutorial"
---

This tutorial explains how to create a Nextstrain build for the Zika virus.
We will first make the build step-by-step using an example data set.
Then we will see how to automate this stepwise process by defining a pathogen build script.

If you haven't already looked at the [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart), you may want to skim through that before continuing with this tutorial.

## Setup

To run this tutorial you'll need either:
* augur and auspice installed -- [see installation instructions here](../getting-started/installation#install-augur-with-conda).
* the nextstrain CLI tool -- see [the quickstart for more info](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).


You'll also need to install `git` -- [see here](/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Build steps

Nextstrain builds typically require the following steps:

1. Prepare pathogen sequences and metadata
2. Align sequences
3. Construct a phylogeny from aligned sequences
4. Annotate the phylogeny with inferred ancestral pathogen dates, sequences, and traits
5. Export the annotated phylogeny and corresponding metadata into auspice-readable format

First, download the Zika pathogen build which includes example data and a pathogen build script.

```
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/zika-tutorial.git
cd zika-tutorial
```

Next, if you're using the conda to install augur & auspice (see above), don't forget to enter the correct environment, e.g.

```
conda activate nextstrain
```
or if you're using the Nextstrain CLI tool, use it to enter the Nextstrain build environment by running:

```
nextstrain shell .
```

Note the dot (`.`) as the last argument; it is important and indicates that your current directory (`zika-tutorial/`) is the build directory.
Your command prompt will change to indicate you are in the build environment.
(If you want to leave the build environment, run the command `exit`.)


## Prepare the Sequences

A Nextstrain build typically starts with a collection of pathogen sequences in a single [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) file and a corresponding table of metadata describing those sequences in a tab-delimited text file.
For this tutorial, we will use an example data set with a subset of 34 viruses.

Each example virus sequence record looks like the following, with the virus's strain id as the sequence name in the header line followed by the virus sequence.

```
>PAN/CDC_259359_V1_V3/2015
gaatttgaagcgaatgctaacaacagtatcaacaggttttattttggatttggaaacgag
agtttctggtcatgaaaaacccaaaaaagaaatccggaggattccggattgtcaatatgc
taaaacgcggagtagcccgtgtgagcccctttgggggcttgaagaggctgccagccggac
ttctgctgggtcatgggcccatcaggatggtcttggcgattctagcctttttgagattca
```

Each sequence record's virus strain id links to the tab-delimited metadata file by the latter's `strain` field.
The metadata file contains a header of column names followed by one row per virus strain id in the sequences file.
An example metadata file looks like the following.

```
strain	virus	accession	date	region	country	division	city	db	segment	authors	url	title	journal	paper_url

```

A metadata file must have the following columns:

  * strain
  * virus
  * date

Builds using published data should include the following additional columns, as shown in the example above:

  * accession (e.g., NCBI GenBank, EMBL EBI, etc.)
  * authors
  * url
  * title
  * journal
  * paper_url

### Filter the Sequences

Filter the parsed sequences and metadata to exclude strains from subsequent analysis and subsample the remaining strains to a fixed number of samples per group.

```
mkdir -p results/

augur filter \
  --sequences data/sequences.fasta \
  --metadata data/metadata.tsv \
  --exclude config/dropped_strains.txt \
  --output results/filtered.fasta \
  --group-by country year month \
  --sequences-per-group 20 \
  --min-date 2012
```

### Align the Sequences

Create a multiple alignment of the sequences using a custom reference.
After this alignment, columns with gaps in the reference are removed.
Additionally, the `--fill-gaps` flag fills gaps in non-reference sequences with "N" characters.
These modifications force all sequences into the same coordinate space as the reference sequence.

```
augur align \
  --sequences results/filtered.fasta \
  --reference-sequence config/zika_outgroup.gb \
  --output results/aligned.fasta \
  --fill-gaps
```

Now the pathogen sequences are ready for analysis.

## Construct the Phylogeny

Infer a phylogenetic tree from the multiple sequence alignment.

```
augur tree \
  --alignment results/aligned.fasta \
  --output results/tree_raw.nwk
```

The resulting tree is stored in [Newick format](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html).
Branch lengths in this tree measure nucleotide divergence.

### Get a Time-Resolved Tree

Augur can also adjust branch lengths in this tree to position tips by their sample date and infer the most likely time of their ancestors, using [TreeTime](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime).
Run the `refine` command to apply TreeTime to the original phylogenetic tree and produce a "time tree".

```
augur refine \
  --tree results/tree_raw.nwk \
  --alignment results/aligned.fasta \
  --metadata data/metadata.tsv \
  --output-tree results/tree.nwk \
  --output-node-data results/branch_lengths.json \
  --timetree \
  --coalescent opt \
  --date-confidence \
  --date-inference marginal \
  --clock-filter-iqd 4
```

In addition to assigning times to internal nodes, the `refine` command filters tips that are likely outliers and assigns confidence intervals to inferred dates.
Branch lengths in the resulting Newick tree measure adjusted nucleotide divergence.
All other data inferred by TreeTime is stored by strain or internal node name in the corresponding JSON file.

## Annotate the Phylogeny

### Reconstruct Ancestral Traits

TreeTime can also infer ancestral traits from an existing phylogenetic tree and metadata annotating each tip of the tree.
The following command infers the region and country of all internal nodes from the time tree and original strain metadata.
As with the `refine` command, the resulting JSON output is indexed by strain or internal node name.

```
augur traits \
  --tree results/tree.nwk \
  --metadata data/metadata.tsv \
  --output results/traits.json \
  --columns region country \
  --confidence
```

### Infer Ancestral Sequences

Next, infer the ancestral sequence of each internal node and identify any nucleotide mutations on the branches leading to any node in the tree.

```
augur ancestral \
  --tree results/tree.nwk \
  --alignment results/aligned.fasta \
  --output results/nt_muts.json \
  --inference joint
```

### Identify Amino-Acid Mutations

Identify amino acid mutations from the nucleotide mutations and a reference sequence with gene coordinate annotations.
The resulting JSON file contains amino acid mutations indexed by strain or internal node name and by gene name.
To export a FASTA file with the complete amino acid translations for each gene from each node’s sequence, specify the `--alignment-output` parameter in the form of `results/aligned_aa_%GENE.fasta`.

```
augur translate \
  --tree results/tree.nwk \
  --ancestral-sequences results/nt_muts.json \
  --reference-sequence config/zika_outgroup.gb \
  --output results/aa_muts.json
```

## Export the Results

Finally, collect all node annotations and metadata and export it all in auspice’s JSON format.
This refers to three config files to define colors via `config/colors.tsv`, lat/long coordinates via `config/lat_longs.tsv` and page title, maintainer, filters present, etc... via `config/auspice_config.json`.
The resulting tree and metadata JSON files are the inputs to the auspice visualization tool.

```
augur export \
  --tree results/tree.nwk \
  --metadata data/metadata.tsv \
  --node-data results/branch_lengths.json \
              results/traits.json \
              results/nt_muts.json \
              results/aa_muts.json \
  --colors config/colors.tsv \
  --lat-longs config/lat_longs.tsv \
  --auspice-config config/auspice_config.json \
  --output-tree auspice/zika_tree.json \
  --output-meta auspice/zika_meta.json
```

## Visualize the Results

If you entered the Nextstrain build environment using `nextstrain shell` at the beginning of this tutorial, leave it now using the `exit` command and then use `nextstrain view` to visualize the Zika build output in `auspice/*.json`.

```
# Leave the shell you entered earlier.
exit

# View results in your auspice/ directory.
nextstrain view auspice/
```

If you're not using the Nextstrain CLI shell, then copy the `auspice/*.json` files into the `data` directory of your local auspice installation and start auspice from there.
You can use the commands below (adjusted if necessary), or copy them using a graphical file explorer.

```
# Copy files into auspice data directory.  Adjust
# paths if auspice isn't installed in ~/src/auspice/.
mkdir ~/src/auspice/data/
cp auspice/*.json ~/src/auspice/data/
```

Then enter your `auspice` directry and start auspice.

```
# Navigate into auspice.
cd ~/src/auspice/data/

# Start auspice.
npm run dev
```

When auspice is running, navigate to <http://localhost:4000/local/zika> in your browser to view the results.

To stop auspice and return to the command line when you are done viewing your data, press CTRL+C.

## Automate the Build with Snakemake

While it is instructive to run all of the above commands manually, it is more practical to automate their execution with a single script.
Nextstrain implements these automated pathogen builds with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) by defining a `Snakefile` like [the one in the Zika repository you downloaded](https://github.com/nextstrain/zika-tutorial/blob/master/Snakefile).

First delete the output from the manual steps above.
(Be sure to navigate into the `zika-tutorial/` directory first.)

```
rm -rf results/ auspice/
```

If you've installed augur / auspice, simply run
```
snakemake
```

or, if you're using the Nextstrain CLI tool, run:

```
nextstrain build .
```

which will run the automated pathogen build.
This runs all of the manual steps above up through the auspice export.
View the results the same way you did before to confirm it produced the same Zika build you made manually.

Note that automated builds will only re-run steps when the data changes.
This means builds will pick up where they left off if they are restarted after being interrupted.
If you want to force a re-run of the whole build, first remove any previous output with `snakemake clean` or `nextstrain build . clean`.
