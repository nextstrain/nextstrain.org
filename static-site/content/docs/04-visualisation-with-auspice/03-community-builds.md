title: "Community sharing of results via GitHub"
---

Our desire is to develop a community of scientists using nextstrain.org to share datasets, and to allow these to be easily updated so that they represent the most up-to-date view of the current situation.
We currently utilise GitHub to achieve this, whereby if JSONs are committed to github repos they can be automatically accessed through nextstrain.org.


Given a repository at **github.com/orgName/repoName**, if there is a folder named **auspice** with JSONs **repoName_tree.json** and **repoName_meta.json**, then that dataset can be accessed via **nextstrain.org/community/orgName/repoName**.
Additional datasets named such as **repoName\_a\_b\_c\_meta.json** are available at **nextstrain.org/community/orgName/repoName/a/b/c**.


For example, [Alli Black's](https://bedford.io/team/allison-black/) analysis of Zika virus in the US Virgin Islands is being updated [in this github repo](https://github.com/blab/zika-usvi/), and you can see the most up-to-date results at [nextstrain.org/community/blab/zika-usvi](https://www.nextstrain.org/community/blab/zika-usvi)
