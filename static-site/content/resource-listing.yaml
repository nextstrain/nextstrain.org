# The following data is used to provide hardcoded data for the resource-listing
# UI such as the tiles, quicklinks etc. This data isn't automatically derived
# and is only (currently) used for the static-site UI. For sources beyond "core"
# (e.g. groups, community), if we want to customise the display it makes more
# sense to store this information in the bucket or repo, respectively, and then
# send it in the API response from the server. 


# Quick links are displayed in the header part of a pathogen group (e.g. "flu"
# or "dengue"). They are displayed in order, as space allows. They act as a
# shortcut to access the resource defined by their "name".
coreQuickLinks:
  # flu quick links taken from tiles on (now removed) /influenza, dropping yam (no seqs) and h5nx instead of h5n1
