# (e.g. groups, community), if we want to customise the display it makes more
# sense to store this information in the bucket or repo, respectively, and then
# send it in the API response from the server.

# Quick links are displayed in the header part of a pathogen group (e.g. "flu"
# or "dengue"). They are displayed in order, as space allows. They act as a
# shortcut to access the resource defined by their "name".
coreQuickLinks:
  # flu quick links taken from tiles on (now removed) /influenza, dropping yam (no seqs) and h5nx instead of h5n1
