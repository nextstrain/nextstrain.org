genomic data. The Nextstrain team analyzes these data on a global and continental
level. More specific analysis are often performed by groups around the world.
This page lists publicly available SARS-CoV-2 analyses that use Nextstrain from
groups all over the world. In addition to exploring SARS-CoV-2 evolution
in finished analyses, you can use our new Nextclade tool to compare your sequences
to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, assign them to clades, and see where they fall
on a the SARS-CoV-2 tree.`;

                    Some of these builds are maintained by the Nextstrain team and others are maintained by independent research groups.
                    See <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/faq/what-is-a-build.html" >here</a> for more information on what a build is, and see <a href="https://nextstrain.github.io/ncov/">this tutorial</a> for a walkthrough of running your own phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data.
