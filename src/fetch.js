   * sole usage of the fetch(url, options) API and doesn't fully support the

   * options like "cache" in uses like:
   *
   *    fetch(new Request(url, {cache: …}))

   * The fetch(request) API is handy in cases where requests are
   * programmatically generated, so work around this limitation by storing the
   * original options passed to Request() and then duplicating them into a
   * fetch(request, options) call in our own fetch() above.

   * ¹ The reason is that internally make-fetch-happen passes around the
   *   options object instead of merging options into its own Request subclass
   *   and only passing around the Request instance.  With a little more work,
   *   I think this would be a good improvement to contribute back to
