## Summary

* The data here are based off a report detailing current seasonal influenza circulation patterns as of Feb 2018 and making
projections up to Feb 2019 to coincide with selection of the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere vaccine
strain.
* The data show 1882 genomes collected between 2012 and 2018 from 113 countries. The data have been subsampled in an attempt to minimise geographic and temporal sampling biases.

## The situation a year ago
A number of clades were vying for dominance.


From top to bottom:
* A1 & A1a
* A2
* A3
* A4

## Last year's vaccine strain
* A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (i.e. from 2014)

## Using twitter II

As international organisations gear up to respond, indications that Ebola virus spreading beyond Guinea come to light in March/April 2014.

The first genetic evidence of Ebola virus infection crossing country borders came from Liberia and Sierra Leone. The handful of Liberian cases did not lead to sustained chains of transmission in the country, but the introduction of Ebola virus into Sierra Leone was a major turning point in the epidemic. One of the labs belonging to the [Viral Hemorrhagic Consortium](http://www.vhfc.org/), originally set up in Kailahun district just across the border from Guinea to study Lassa fever virus, sequenced the first known Ebola virus transmission chain in Sierra Leone.

## Coloring by titer shows that there were no drastic titer drops
* Titers show how successfully serum raised from one virus neutralises another, and can be used as a proxy for immune response.
* In this case, the serum can be thought of as the root of the tree (roughly similar to last year's vaccine strain)
* Cooler colors show good responses, whereas warmer colors are indicative of poor protection (_in vitro_)
* Very few viruses have log-titer drops over 0.5, indicating that the virus strain _should_ have provided relatively good protection.
